Sources inside the FBI have confessed to reporters there are \\u201csmoking gun\\u201d bombshells on the devices and she could be facing time behind bars.

[None of them were Muslim. All ten were from the Ukraine, and were either Baptist, Evangelical Christian, Uniate (a branch of Christian denomination found in eastern Europe) or Pentecostalist, according to the Department of State\\u2019s interactive website.  Across the rest of the country, it was a different story. More than 75 percent of the 189 refugees who arrived in other parts of the United States on Tuesday, 151 in total, were Muslim, according to the Department of State\\u2019s interactive website. It was the ultimate irony, since Judge Robart based his decision on an argument from Washington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson that Trump\\u2019s executive order was unconstitutional because it was motivated by a desire to ban Muslims. \\u201cPrior to his election, Donald Trump campaigned on the promise that he would ban Muslims from entering the United States,\\u201d Ferguson alleged in the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief filed by the state of Washington with the United States District Court Western District of Washington on January 30, 2017: On December 7, 2015, candidate Trump issued a press release calling for \\u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. \\u201d As of the date of this filing, the press release remains available on Trump\\u2019s campaign website and is attached hereto as Exhibit 1. In defending his decision shortly thereafter, candidate Trump compared the Muslim ban to former President Franklin Roosevelt\\u2019s decision to intern Japanese Americans during World War II, and stated, \\u201cThis is a president highly respected by all, [Roosevelt] did the same thing. \\u201d A media report of this interview is attached hereto as Exhibit 2. On June 14, 2016, candidate Trump reiterated his promise to ban all Muslims entering this country until \\u201cwe as a nation are in a position to properly and perfectly screenthose people coming into our country. \\u201d \\u201cSection 3 of the Executive Order, if implemented, will result in substantial burdens on the exercise of religion by   immigrants by, for example, preventing them from exercising their religion while in detention, returning to their religious communities in Washington,   taking upcoming, planned religious travel abroad. Such burdens on religion violate the Religious Freedom Restoration Act,\\u201d Ferguson argued in the January 30 complaint. In response to the Department of Justice\\u2019s appeal of Judge Robart\\u2019s decision to the 9th Federal Circuit Court, Ferguson restated that claim. \\u201cHere, the State [of Washington] has plausibly alleged with sufficient particularity that the President acted in bad faith in an effort to target Muslims,\\u201d Ferguson argued  in States\\u2019 Response to Emergency Motion Under Circuit Rule   for Administrative Stay and Motion for Stay Pending Appeal filed with the 9th Federal Circuit Court on February 6, continuing with that theme. In the week between President Trump\\u2019s signing of the executive order on January 27 and Judge Robart\\u2019s issuance of the temporary restraining order halting it nationwide on February 3, the Trump administration granted waivers allowing 842 refugees to enter the country. One hundred and   of those refugees, or 15 percent, were Muslim, according to the State Department\\u2019s interactive website.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Read more Russia withdraws request for carrier battle group to refuel in Spain amid NATO pressure on Madrid \\n\\u201cToday, the Spanish authorities told [Russian Defense Ministry] that Russian vessels\\u2019 call at the Ceuta port is inappropriate due to the pressure on Spain exerted by the US and NATO,\\u201d Konashenkov said, adding that \\u201cthis situation in no way affects the mission plan of the naval group.\\u201d \\nEarlier on Wednesday there were reports, citing embassy sources, that Russia withdrew a request for its aircraft carrier group to be refueled at the Ceuta port after top NATO and EU officials expressed anger at Spain\\u2019s reported decision to allow the stopover. \\nThe Russian embassy in Spain says that its statement was misinterpreted. There were \\u201cmost diverse media interpretations of the Russian embassy\\u2019s statement\\u2026 concerning the Russian naval group in the Mediterranean,\\u201d Vasily Nioradze, a spokesman of the Russian embassy in Madrid, told RT, adding that \\u201cin fact, Russian mission informed the Spanish side that Russian vessels would not stop at the Ceuta port as the plans have changed.\\u201d \\n\\u201cIt was just a routine procedure of mutual information-sharing,\\u201d he stressed. \\nA barrage of harsh criticism from the NATO officials and some European politicians followed Spanish media reports that Russia\\u2019s naval battle group would make a stopover in Ceuta after passing the Straits of Gibraltar. \\nCeuta, the autonomous Spanish port located on the tip of Africa\\u2019s northern coast not far from the Straits of Gibraltar, has an unresolved status within NATO. It is, however, considered EU territory. Since 2011, Spain has allowed 57 Russian warships to refuel at the enclave. \\nThe mission of the Admiral Kuznetsov carrier group earlier triggered a media frenzy across Europe alongside with the nervous reaction from some European countries\\u2019 military as British, Norwegian, and Dutch navies sending frigates and surveillance vessels to shadow the Russian warships on their way through international waters. \\nAccording to the Russia\\u2019s Defense Ministry, the ships were sent to the Syrian coast to provide backup for the naval group already deployed in the area.\",\n          \"BERLIN (AP)  \\u2014   Germany\\u2019s foreign minister says there may now be a chance of a \\u201csoft\\u201d British exit from the European Union that keeps the U. K. in the bloc\\u2019s single market, but is warning that Britain couldn\\u2019t pick and choose its conditions. [Brexit negotiations start on Monday, with question marks over Britain\\u2019s approach after Prime Minister Theresa May lost her parliamentary majority in an election meant to strengthen her hand in the talks.  German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel told Sunday\\u2019s Welt am Sonntag newspaper that \\u201cmaybe there is now a chance to achieve a   \\u2018soft Brexit. \\u2019\\u201d But he said staying in the single market would require Britain to accept EU workers\\u2019 freedom of movement. It also would have to accept the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, \\u201cor at least a joint court that is staffed by Europeans and Britons\\u201d and in principle follows the ECJ\\u2019s rulings, Gabriel said. For many Brexit advocates, those conditions would be impossible to accept as last year\\u2019s referendum campaign focused on getting back control over laws and immigration from the EU. Gabriel said \\u201cit would naturally be best if Britain didn\\u2019t leave at all. \\u201d \\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t look like that at the moment,\\u201d he added. \\u201cBut we want to keep the door open for the British. \\u201d The   Social Democrat strongly criticized May\\u2019s Conservatives, saying that they \\u201cplayed with the emotions of citizens in Britain, told fake news about Europe and left people unclear about what consequences this would all have. \\u201d Referring to the \\u201cdifficult, even impossible situation\\u201d created by the indecisive election, he added: \\u201chere, those who created such chaos would have long since gone. \\u201d \\u201cWe will negotiate fairly,\\u201d Gabriel was quoted as saying. \\u201cAnd fair means that we want to keep the British as close as possible to the EU  \\u2014   but never at the price that we divide the remaining 27 EU states. \\u201d\",\n          \"Think you have witnessed enough amazing inventions in the world?

Read more Russia withdraws request for carrier battle group to refuel in Spain amid NATO pressure on Madrid \\n\\u201cToday, the Spanish authorities told [Russian Defense Ministry] that Russian vessels\\u2019 call at the Ceuta port is inappropriate due to the pressure on Spain exerted by the US and NATO,\\u201d Konashenkov said, adding that \\u201cthis situation in no way affects the mission plan of the naval group.\\u201d \\nEarlier on Wednesday there were reports, citing embassy sources, that Russia withdrew a request for its aircraft carrier group to be refueled at the Ceuta port after top NATO and EU officials expressed anger at Spain\\u2019s reported decision to allow the stopover. \\nThe Russian embassy in Spain says that its statement was misinterpreted. There were \\u201cmost diverse media interpretations of the Russian embassy\\u2019s statement\\u2026 concerning the Russian naval group in the Mediterranean,\\u201d Vasily Nioradze, a spokesman of the Russian embassy in Madrid, told RT, adding that \\u201cin fact, Russian mission informed the Spanish side that Russian vessels would not stop at the Ceuta port as the plans have changed.\\u201d \\n\\u201cIt was just a routine procedure of mutual information-sharing,\\u201d he stressed. \\nA barrage of harsh criticism from the NATO officials and some European politicians followed Spanish media reports that Russia\\u2019s naval battle group would make a stopover in Ceuta after passing the Straits of Gibraltar. \\nCeuta, the autonomous Spanish port located on the tip of Africa\\u2019s northern coast not far from the Straits of Gibraltar, has an unresolved status within NATO. It is, however, considered EU territory. Since 2011, Spain has allowed 57 Russian warships to refuel at the enclave. \\nThe mission of the Admiral Kuznetsov carrier group earlier triggered a media frenzy across Europe alongside with the nervous reaction from some European countries\\u2019 military as British, Norwegian, and Dutch navies sending frigates and surveillance vessels to shadow the Russian warships on their way through international waters. \\nAccording to the Russia\\u2019s Defense Ministry, the ships were sent to the Syrian coast to provide backup for the naval group already deployed in the area.\",\n          \"BERLIN (AP)  \\u2014   Germany\\u2019s foreign minister says there may now be a chance of a \\u201csoft\\u201d British exit from the European Union that keeps the U.

[Brexit negotiations start on Monday, with question marks over Britain\\u2019s approach after Prime Minister Theresa May lost her parliamentary majority in an election meant to strengthen her hand in the talks.  German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel told Sunday\\u2019s Welt am Sonntag newspaper that \\u201cmaybe there is now a chance to achieve a   \\u2018soft Brexit. \\u2019\\u201d But he said staying in the single market would require Britain to accept EU workers\\u2019 freedom of movement. It also would have to accept the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, \\u201cor at least a joint court that is staffed by Europeans and Britons\\u201d and in principle follows the ECJ\\u2019s rulings, Gabriel said. For many Brexit advocates, those conditions would be impossible to accept as last year\\u2019s referendum campaign focused on getting back control over laws and immigration from the EU. Gabriel said \\u201cit would naturally be best if Britain didn\\u2019t leave at all. \\u201d \\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t look like that at the moment,\\u201d he added. \\u201cBut we want to keep the door open for the British. \\u201d The   Social Democrat strongly criticized May\\u2019s Conservatives, saying that they \\u201cplayed with the emotions of citizens in Britain, told fake news about Europe and left people unclear about what consequences this would all have. \\u201d Referring to the \\u201cdifficult, even impossible situation\\u201d created by the indecisive election, he added: \\u201chere, those who created such chaos would have long since gone. \\u201d \\u201cWe will negotiate fairly,\\u201d Gabriel was quoted as saying. \\u201cAnd fair means that we want to keep the British as close as possible to the EU  \\u2014   but never at the price that we divide the remaining 27 EU states. \\u201d\",\n          \"Think you have witnessed enough amazing inventions in the world?

              "'House Dem Aide: We Didn’t Even See Comey’s Letter Until Jason Chaffetz Tweeted It By Darrell Lucus on October 30, 2016 Subscribe Jason Chaffetz on the stump in American Fork, Utah ( image courtesy Michael Jolley, available under a Creative Commons-BY license) \\nWith apologies to Keith Olbermann, there is no doubt who the Worst Person in The World is this week–FBI Director James Comey. But according to a House Democratic aide, it looks like we also know who the second-worst person is as well. It turns out that when Comey sent his now-infamous letter announcing that the FBI was looking into emails that may be related to Hillary Clinton’s email server, the ranking Democrats on the relevant committees didn’t hear about it from Comey. They found out via a tweet from one of the Republican committee chairmen. \\nAs we now know, Comey notified the Republican chairmen and Democratic ranking members of the House Intelligence, Judiciary, and Oversight committees that his agency was reviewing emails it had recently discovered in order to see if they contained classified information. Not long after this letter went out, Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz set the political world ablaze with this tweet. FBI Dir just informed me, \"The FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.\" Case reopened \\n— Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) October 28, 2016 \\nOf course, we now know that this was not the case . Comey was actually saying that it was reviewing the emails in light of “an unrelated case”–which we now know to be Anthony Weiner’s sexting with a teenager. But apparently such little things as facts didn’t matter to Chaffetz. The Utah Republican had already vowed to initiate a raft of investigations if Hillary wins–at least two years’ worth, and possibly an entire term’s worth of them. Apparently Chaffetz thought the FBI was already doing his work for him–resulting in a tweet that briefly roiled the nation before cooler heads realized it was a dud. \\nBut according to a senior House Democratic aide, misreading that letter may have been the least of Chaffetz’ sins. That aide told Shareblue that his boss and other Democrats didn’t even know about Comey’s letter at the time–and only found out when they checked Twitter. “Democratic Ranking Members on the relevant committees didn’t receive Comey’s letter until after the Republican Chairmen. In fact, the Democratic Ranking Members didn’ receive it until after the Chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Jason Chaffetz, tweeted it out and made it public.” \\nSo let’s see if we’ve got this right. The FBI director tells Chaffetz and other GOP committee chairmen about a major development in a potentially politically explosive investigation, and neither Chaffetz nor his other colleagues had the courtesy to let their Democratic counterparts know about it. Instead, according to this aide, he made them find out about it on Twitter. \\nThere has already been talk on Daily Kos that Comey himself provided advance notice of this letter to Chaffetz and other Republicans, giving them time to turn on the spin machine. That may make for good theater, but there is nothing so far that even suggests this is the case. After all, there is nothing so far that suggests that Comey was anything other than grossly incompetent and tone-deaf. \\nWhat it does suggest, however, is that Chaffetz is acting in a way that makes Dan Burton and Darrell Issa look like models of responsibility and bipartisanship. He didn’t even have the decency to notify ranking member Elijah Cummings about something this explosive. If that doesn’t trample on basic standards of fairness, I don’t know what does. \\nGranted, it’s not likely that Chaffetz will have to answer for this. He sits in a ridiculously Republican district anchored in Provo and Orem; it has a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+25, and gave Mitt Romney a punishing 78 percent of the vote in 2012. Moreover, the Republican House leadership has given its full support to Chaffetz’ planned fishing expedition. But that doesn’t mean we can’t turn the hot lights on him. After all, he is a textbook example of what the House has become under Republican control. And he is also the Second Worst Person in the World.

              "'Ever get the feeling your life circles the roundabout rather than heads in a straight line toward the intended destination? [Hillary Clinton remains the big woman on campus in leafy, liberal Wellesley, Massachusetts. Everywhere else votes her most likely to don her inauguration dress for the remainder of her days the way Miss Havisham forever wore that wedding dress.  Speaking of Great Expectations, Hillary Rodham overflowed with them 48 years ago when she first addressed a Wellesley graduating class. The president of the college informed those gathered in 1969 that the students needed “no debate so far as I could ascertain as to who their spokesman was to be” (kind of the like the Democratic primaries in 2016 minus the   terms unknown then even at a Seven Sisters school). “I am very glad that Miss Adams made it clear that what I am speaking for today is all of us —  the 400 of us,” Miss Rodham told her classmates. After appointing herself Edger Bergen to the Charlie McCarthys and Mortimer Snerds in attendance, the    bespectacled in granny glasses (awarding her matronly wisdom —  or at least John Lennon wisdom) took issue with the previous speaker. Despite becoming the first   to win election to a seat in the U. S. Senate since Reconstruction, Edward Brooke came in for criticism for calling for “empathy” for the goals of protestors as he criticized tactics. Though Clinton in her senior thesis on Saul Alinsky lamented “Black Power demagogues” and “elitist arrogance and repressive intolerance” within the New Left, similar words coming out of a Republican necessitated a brief rebuttal. “Trust,” Rodham ironically observed in 1969, “this is one word that when I asked the class at our rehearsal what it was they wanted me to say for them, everyone came up to me and said ‘Talk about trust, talk about the lack of trust both for us and the way we feel about others. Talk about the trust bust.’ What can you say about it? What can you say about a feeling that permeates a generation and that perhaps is not even understood by those who are distrusted?” The “trust bust” certainly busted Clinton’s 2016 plans. She certainly did not even understand that people distrusted her. After Whitewater, Travelgate, the vast   conspiracy, Benghazi, and the missing emails, Clinton found herself the distrusted voice on Friday. There was a load of compromising on the road to the broadening of her political horizons. And distrust from the American people —  Trump edged her 48 percent to 38 percent on the question immediately prior to November’s election —  stood as a major reason for the closing of those horizons. Clinton described her vanquisher and his supporters as embracing a “lie,” a “con,” “alternative facts,” and “a   assault on truth and reason. ” She failed to explain why the American people chose his lies over her truth. “As the history majors among you here today know all too well, when people in power invent their own facts and attack those who question them, it can mark the beginning of the end of a free society,” she offered. “That is not hyperbole. ” Like so many people to emerge from the 1960s, Hillary Clinton embarked upon a long, strange trip. From high school Goldwater Girl and Wellesley College Republican president to Democratic politician, Clinton drank in the times and the place that gave her a degree. More significantly, she went from idealist to cynic, as a comparison of her two Wellesley commencement addresses show. Way back when, she lamented that “for too long our leaders have viewed politics as the art of the possible, and the challenge now is to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible possible. ” Now, as the big woman on campus but the odd woman out of the White House, she wonders how her current station is even possible. “Why aren’t I 50 points ahead?” she asked in September. In May she asks why she isn’t president. The woman famously dubbed a “congenital liar” by Bill Safire concludes that lies did her in —  theirs, mind you, not hers. Getting stood up on Election Day, like finding yourself the jilted bride on your wedding day, inspires dangerous delusions.'"

Photo of Hellfire missiles being loaded onto a US military Reaper drone in Afghanistan by Staff Sgt. Brian Ferguson/U.S. Air Force. \\nThe Bureau has been able to identify 15 civilians killed in a single US drone strike in Afghanistan last month – the biggest loss of civilian life in one strike since the attack on the Medecins Sans Frontieres hospital (MSF) last October. \\nThe US claimed it had conducted a “counter-terrorism” strike against Islamic State (IS) fighters when it hit Nangarhar province with missiles on September 28. But the next day the United Nations issued an unusually rapid and strong statement saying the strike had killed 15 civilians and injured 13 others who had gathered at a house to celebrate a tribal elder’s return from a pilgrimage to Mecca. \\nThe Bureau spoke to a man named Haji Rais who said he was the owner of the house that was targeted. He said 15 people were killed and 19 others injured, and provided their names (listed below). The Bureau was able to independently verify the identities of those who died. \\nRais’ son, a headmaster at a local school, was among them. Another man, Abdul Hakim, lost three of his sons in the attack. \\nRais said he had no involvement with IS and denied US claims that IS members had visited his house before the strike. He said: “I did not even speak to those sort of people on the phone let alone receiving them in my house.” \\nThe deaths amount to the biggest confirmed loss of civilian life in a single American strike in Afghanistan since the attack on the MSF hospital in Kunduz last October, which killed at least 42 people. \\nThe Nangarhar strike was not the only US attack to kill civilians in September. The Bureau’s data indicates that as many as 45 civilians and allied soldiers were killed in four American strikes in Afghanistan and Somalia that month. \\nOn September 18 a pair of strikes killed eight Afghan policemen in Tarinkot, the capital of Urozgan provice. US jets reportedly hit a police checkpoint, killing one officer, before returning to target first responders. The use of this tactic – known as a “double-tap” strike – is controversial because they often hit civilian rescuers. \\nThe US told the Bureau it had conducted the strike against individuals firing on and posing a threat to Afghan forces. The email did not directly address the allegations of Afghan policemen being killed. \\nAt the end of the month in Somalia, citizens burnt US flags on the streets of the north-central city of Galcayo after it emerged a drone attack may have unintentionally killed 22 Somali soldiers and civilians. The strike occurred on the same day as the one in Nangarhar. \\nIn both the Somali and Afghan incidents, the US at first denied that any non-combatants had been killed. It is now investigating both the strikes in Nangarhar and Galcayo. \\nThe rate at which civilians are being killed by American airstrikes in Afghanistan is now higher than it was in 2014 when the US was engaged in active combat operations.
